<h2>The Event</h2>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> Returns...</p>
<p>Calling all campers. Get ready to spend a day learning from, and networking
  with, the greatest accessibility community around. That’s right,
  <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> is back for 2025. Join us Saturday, April 26th
  at the League Offices in beautiful downtown Toronto.</p>
<p>Due to limited capacity for this year’s event, to curb the number of no-shows,
  we will be charging a nominal amount to secure your ticket. Your $20 entrance
  fee will go towards our expected costs for ASL and Captioning, as well as
  lunch.</p>
<p>Our call for presentation submissions is now closed.</p>
<p>Thank you and we hope to see you all in Toronto this April.</p>
<p>The <strong>#a11yTO Team</strong></p>
