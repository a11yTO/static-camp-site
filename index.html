<h2>The Event</h2>

<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> returns on Saturday, May 23, 2020 for another awesome day of accessibility talks marking Global Accessibility Awareness Day! Given that we can’t welcome you all to OCAD this year, we’re hoping you will welcome us into your home as <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> goes virtual for the first time ever!</p>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> will be a two-track event, with 8 talks in total. We lined up a fantastic playlist of speakers for you. Please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/a11yto-camp-2020-registration-104495817804" target="_blank">register now</a> and plan on sitting back at home with your favourite beverage and slippers.</p>
