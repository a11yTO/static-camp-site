<h2>The Event</h2>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> is back for 2024! </p>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> is about making friends, sharing ideas, and growing our community. <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> encourages fresh voices to join in conversation with industry leaders. We welcome new ideas and seek to provide a diverse schedule.</p>
<h2>#a11yOpen</h2>
<p>We know that plenty of you come to camp not only wanting to consume, but to contribute. So here's your chance! We decided to save a space on the schedule just for you and introduce what we like to call the <strong>#a11yOpen</strong>.</p>
