<h2>The Event</h2>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> Returns...</p>
<p>
  Calling all campers. Get ready to spend a day learning from, and networking
  with, the greatest accessibility community around. That’s right,
  <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> is back for 2025. Join us Saturday, April 26th
  at the League Offices in beautiful downtown Toronto.
</p>
<p>
  Due to limited capacity for this year’s event, to curb the number of no-shows,
  we will be charging a nominal amount to secure your ticket. Your $20 entrance
  fee will go towards our expected costs for ASL and Captioning, as well as
  lunch.
</p>
<p>
  Have a great idea for a talk?
