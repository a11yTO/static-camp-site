<h2>The Event</h2>

<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> returns on Saturday, May 23, 2020 for another awesome day of accessibility talks! Given that we can’t welcome you all to OCAD this year, we’re hoping you will welcome us into your home as <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> goes virtual for the first time ever!</p>
<p>We lined up a fantastic playlist of speakers for you. Please <a href="#">register now</a> and plan on sitting back at home with your favourite beverage and slippers.</p>
