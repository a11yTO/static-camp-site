<h2>The Event</h2>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> is back for 2024! </p>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> is about making friends, sharing ideas, and growing our community. <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> encourages fresh voices to join in conversation with industry leaders. We welcome new ideas and seek to provide a diverse schedule.</p>
<h2>#a11yOpen</h2>
<p>We know that plenty of you come to camp not only wanting to consume, but to contribute. So here's your chance! Inspired by Open Space events, we decided to put our own spin on things this year and introduce what we like to call the <strong>#a11yOpen</strong>.</p>
