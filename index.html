<h1>The Event</h1>

<p>We are currently scouting locations for <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong>. As you can imagine, with things starting to open back up, it’s been a little difficult to secure a venue but fear not, we’ll get that sorted out in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’d like to share some information about an exciting format change to <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong>. Starting this year, we’re going to back to our roots and running <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> event as a traditional BarCamp with a single track, shorter talks, and lots of opportunities to engage with the community.</p>
<p>The <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> call for presentations will open shortly and you’ll get your chance to vote for the talks that interest you. Stay tuned for more info!</p>
