    <p>With 20+ years working in disability inclusion, and 6+ years developing a fitness business that pivoted through the pandemic, my passion for inclusion and curiosity for innovation merged together to create Sekond Skin Society, the most accessible and inclusive fitness app about to hit the market!</p>
    <p>I'm proud to be a thought leader, advocate for accessibility, inclusion and belonging, disruptor in fitness tech, speaker, coach and mentor, and a great listener.</p>
