    <p>Currently Manager, Digital Accessibility at CNIB Access Labs, Bob began his career designing and building real-time software for industrial automation. These days the automation he builds is for accessibility testing at CNIB where, in addition to his day job of providing consulting services, he also produces some of the tools and reporting platforms used. Prior to working for CNIB, Bob spent the 2000's working first on his masters, and later a PhD candidate focused on modelling adaptive user interfaces that meet user needs and preferences. He has peer-reviewed papers available through the ACM Digital Library, including "The CISNA model of accessible adaptive hypermedia".</p>
