            <h2>Giving, Receiving and Understanding Accessible Feedback</h2>
            <p class="speakerName">Aamer Khan</p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/Access_Aamer" target="_blank">@Access_Aamer</a>
            <p>What are the best practices for organizing, understanding and using feedback on accessibility? How should feedback be written in the first place?</p>
            <p>We will review real examples of feedback, their answers and share the lessons learned.</p>

            <h2>Re-imagining Document Accessibility</h2>
            <p class="speakerName">Adam Spencer</p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/accessibilit" target="_blank">@accessibilit</a>
            <p>Document accessibility strategies have moved beyond having your authors try to make documents accessible by exporting files. Organizations are moving too quickly for internal manual remediation to be a viable solution. This session will explore a multi-approach strategy for ensuring all content is accessible and compliant.</p>

            <a href="https://twitter.com/aardrian" target="_blank">@aardrian</a>
            <p>If you've embraced inclusive design, next is to integrate it into user testing by incorporating people with disabilities into your process.</p>

            <!--             <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFourney" target="_blank">@DavidFourney</a>   -->
            <p>It has been said that captioning videos is both an art and a science. This presentation will provide a basic explanation of how captioning is supported by HTML5 and CSS (the "science") and cover a range of tips and ideas for making captions work for deaf, deafened, and hard of hearing consumers (the "art").</p>

            <p>Accessibility is more than just making things work in a screen reader. This talk discusses Windows High Contrast Mode's capabilities and limitations, and how to best design and develop for it.</p>

            <a href="https://twitter.com/EverettZufelt" target="_blank">@EverettZufelt</a>            
            <p>There is a long-held belief among developers that any application built using JavaScript is necessarily not accessible. This belief is reinforced by the rapid adoption of JavaScript frameworks and UI components that are immature, and by the corners that get cut when time to market takes priority over inclusivity. But JavaScript is not to blame!</p>

            <h2>The Accessibility of Keyboard Navigation</h2>
            <p class="speakerName">George Zamfir</p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/georgezamfir" target="_blank">@georgezamfir</a>
            <p>At Slack we're building the capability to use the app by keyboard as easily if not easier than via the mouse. And we'd like to share the decisions we've made to build this new navigation model, including but not limited to the controversial decision to break TAB navigation. Also, present the problems we've had to solve, e.g. infinite scroll, keyboard traps, visual focus, and generally what our thinking is around what a great, accessible experience looks like.</p>
            <p>We hope there are lessons to be learned from our decisions & mistakes.</p>

            <h2>What I've Learned About A11y After Four Years at LinkedIn and In The Silicon Valley</h2>
            <p class="speakerName">Jennison Asuncion</p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/Jennison" target="_blank">@Jennison</a>
            <p>November marks the four-year mark that I was given an amazing opportunity to come to the Silicon Valley to direct a11y efforts at LinkedIn, having spent almost seven years learning and growing on RBC's IT Accessibility Team. In a conversational format, I'd like to share stories about some of the things I've learned and done building an a11y program in Silicon Valley, as well as what the scene is like out here in general when it comes to digital access/inclusion.</p>

            <h2>Inclusive UX Design: Past, Present & Future</h2>
            <p class="speakerName">Kaleem Khan</p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/kaleemux" target="_blank">@kaleemux</a>
            <p>Many of us are daunted when we first think about inclusive design and the scale of the challenges that face us. We don't need to be afraid. </p>
            <p> This talk is an introduction to inclusive design, its history, current state, and its future in the context of user experience design. I discuss how accessibility and UX relate to each other, as well as some first steps, examples, and resources to get started and have an immediate impact as soon as you go back to work. Finally, I will discuss some approaches and frameworks, and how to think about inclusive UX design as you begin and progress in your journey. </p>
            <p> Suitable for anyone who wants to create a more inclusive world. No prior knowledge required.</p>

            <!-- <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelTurnbull" target="_blank">@MichaelTurnbull</a>             -->
            <p>To be a great interactive designer, you have to dive deep to understand your audience. If you open your concepts to others sooner, and get inclusive feedback, you provide better experiences for all users, and take things less personally.</p>

            <a href="https://twitter.com/touficsbeiti" target="_blank">@touficsbeiti</a>
            <p>Web accessibility is usually described as the degree of usability of your website for people with disability. But do you know that EVERYONE benefits from an "accessible" website? This talk is about me watching my favorite show on Netflix in various environments where I was relayed upon "accessible" features. Using real examples, I am hoping to share ideas to improve your website to all your clients by ensuring your website is conform to WCAG.</p>
