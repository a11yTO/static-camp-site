description: We decided to put our own spin on things this year and introduce something new.

<p>What is <strong>#a11yOpen</strong> you ask? It's quite simple, we take a large room and host a conversation about a specific accessibility related topic in each corner. These conversations will run for a pre-determined length of time, when the time runs out, we reset the clock and four new conversations begin. We are looking at running 4 groups of 4 talks over a 2 hour block.</p>
<h2 class="sub-head" id="jump">What is it happening?</h2>
<p>That's the fun part, this is a camp inside a camp! The actual event will run from 1:30-3:30pm, with topic submissions open from 9am-12:45pm. You can start thinking about the topics that interest you the most right now and then get them on the board in the <strong>#a11yOpen</strong> room as soon as the doors open on April 6. The sooner they are up, the more likely they are that they'll be selected for the event.</p>
<h2 class="sub-head">How do we select the talks?</h2>
<p>WE don't. It's 100% up to you! During the morning up until 12:45pm, everyone is encouraged to vote for whichever topics interest them the most. The topics with the most amount of votes will be selected. Don't see a topic that piques your interest? Then add your own!</p>
<p>What if I don't like the conversation, or two topics that interest me are happening at the same time?
Easy, leave one and join another! The beauty of the <strong>#a11yOpen</strong> is that you are free to circulate and join for a little or as long as you'd like.</p>
<p>Some basic rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Don't monopolize the conversation. Even if the topic was your suggestion, these are NOT lightning talks or sales pitches. You are there to engage in polite conversation to share ideas and opinions around a specific topic.</li>
  <li>Stay on topic. The topics were selected because they received enough votes from people who wanted to talk about them.</li>
  <li>Be respectful. We are there to engage with each other and share opinions. We are not there to argue or make anyone feel as though their opinion isn't valuable.</li>
  <li>Pitches get stitches. For real. If your talk suggestion turns into a sales pitch, we will shut it down.</li>
  <li>Try to keep things positive. The idea here is to share and discuss, not complain about things.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>Most importantly, have fun!</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: due to the conversational nature of this event, our usual level of accommodation will be impacted. Should you require captions <a href="mailto:info@a11yto.com">please contact us and let us know</a>.</p>
