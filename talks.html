<section id="Testing-Mobile-Sites-and-Native-Apps-for-Accessibility" class="talk">
  <h2 class="talk-name">Mobile Accessibility: Testing Mobile Sites and Native Apps for Accessibility​</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Unfortunately, WCAG2 doesn’t cover mobile accessibility very well. For example, WCAG2 requires that all content be accessible to the keyboard interface, but it does not require that all content be accessible to a touchscreen user. WCAG2.1 does include some mobile accessibility requirements; but many think it doesn’t go far enough. Enter the Mobile Site Testing Guidelines: developed by a bipartisan group of accessibility companies. These guidelines are meant to be used with WCAG2 (and WCAG2.1) to ensure that sites are accessible to people with disabilities using mobile and tablet devices.</p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">​ARRM: A Framework of Ownership for Digital Teams to Get Accessibility Done</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Who owns accessibility in your organization? Does everyone know what role they play and how to contribute? The Accessibility Roles & Responsibilities Mapping (ARRM) methodology is highly effective, collaborative team exercise for finding solutions to accessibility issues that your team needs to tackle (related to WCAG as well as best practices). The outcome is clarity around who is doing what - assigning ownership to those with related skills to fix them – whether it be designers, developers, visual designers, or content authors.  Jennifer will walk you through the 7-step Role-Based Decision Tree and other resources to get started.</p>
