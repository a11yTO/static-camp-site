<section id="Accessibility-in-Communications" class="talk">
  <h2 class="talk-name">​Accessibility in Communications</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>​There has been a push for communicators to be more inclusive, equitable, and diverse in their content; however, accessibility remains an afterthought. With 15% of the world's population having a disability, and more specifically, 10% having a print disability, we must ensure that anyone can use the digital content we create. From creating accessible social media content to hosting in-person and virtual events to creating accessible documents, all of these play a part in creating an accessible presence for your brand. As we progress into a post-COVID world, it's time to embrace what accessibility means. Through polling, clips, and some hands-on practice, attendees will leave knowing how to use accessibility best practices to better their communications and digital content.</p>
