    <div class="bio">
      <p>I've been a product designer since 2009. I love to translate complex problems and products into simple solutions, reaching different users in an accessible and inclusive experience. I'm focused on experience design and have an MBA in Business Process with the goal of scaling up design solutions at a corporate level and better integrating them across all areas of the company.</p>
      <p>I've been working in the financial industry for almost my whole career, building digital products for several companies, such as: Santander, Itaú Unibanco, XP Investimentos, CSU and Relay Financial, and also having experience with different financial products, like debit or credit cards, investments, credit / loan, checking and savings accounts, spend management, business accounts, and others.</p>
      <p>I'm also deeply involved in themes related to inclusion and accessibility, especially in the digital environment. In 2021, I built and led a team that developed these topics inside XP Inc and, for that, I received an award called "Women that Transform". I also do free mentoring and keynotes in order to expand the community's knowledge and to create a good impact on future products, services and next generations of product designers.</p>

<section id="Cultural-bias-in-design" class="talk">
  <h2 class="talk-name">Cultural bias in design - How to work with different cultures </h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Toronto is considered one of the most diverse populous cities in the world, where 52% of the city's population identify as visible minorities and under half of Torontonians are immigrants. As Canada continues to welcome more immigrants into the country, our workforce is becoming more diverse of people from different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. But it also comes with challenges and misunderstandings when interacting with people that have different experiences from us and this is mostly due to the fact everyone thinks differently and culture is one of the reasons that shape our thinking and self-identity.</p>
    <p>This talk will discuss some common cultural biases in the workforce, why some cultures will think and act differently compared to others, and the importance of DEI initiatives like Employee Resource Groups can create a more inclusive culture in learning that will help in working cohesively in a product team.</p>

      <p>Hi, I'm Lori! I'm a UX Designer at a consulting company called Avanade and have been working there for 2 years.
