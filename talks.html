  <h2 id="Creating-Safe-Spaces" class="talk-title">Creating Safe Spaces for Diverse Teams to Thrive</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>We know disability inclusion is good for business and we're starting to see the data that highlights how innovation is inspired when people with disabilities are part of the workforce. For project managers rallying teams to executive and business analysts looking to optimize, disability inclusion can be a game changer, but only if it's accessible for people to contribute in the most meaningful ways. This means challenging current systems and processes and allowing for diverse perspectives to highlight better ways of doing things. We must create the spaces where it's safe to challenge current systems and where we can be open to "different" being "better" than what we currently know. How can we create these spaces?</p>
    <p>Talk Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're going to "get it wrong" - Let's talk about learning and changing to get it right.</li>
      <li>Are you (and your ego) in the way of progress? Change doesn't always mean the way you were doing it was "bad" (How do you know if you've had your favourite meal if you're closed-minded and stuck in your usual dinner rotation?).</li>
      <li>Is the future of workplace health and safety disability inclusion training? I think so! Let's discuss.</li>
    </ul>

<section aria-labelledby="Localizing-Digital-Accessibility" class="talk">
  <h2 id="Localizing-Digital-Accessibility" class="talk-title">Localizing Digital Accessibility to an Asian Market</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>The majority of the a11y movements are still primarily focused in Europe and North America. However, with the enforcement of EAA, the vendors who won their contracts in East Asia are experiencing a growing pain in the topic. They are asked to ensure their applications to be compliant to EAA when they knew nothing about. The gap for this implies opportunities. However, the opportunities also mean they are starting from almost ground zero. Aside from the language barriers, they also encounter the needs for localizing the concepts to their work.</p>
    <p>This talk focuses on Solomon's experiences in communicating the concepts and the ups and downs when translating the whole initiative to the locals while ensuring nothing is lost in translations.</p>
