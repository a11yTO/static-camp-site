  <h2 id="Introducing-ARRM" class="talk-title">Introducing ARRM: Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping for WCAG to Get Things Done</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>After 8 years in the making, it's finally here! In February 2025 the W3C published the draft of the W3C Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping (ARRM) resource for WCAG 2.2. </p>
    <p>We'll demonstrate this quick and helpful guide to identify which tasks and WCAG success criteria are owned by each team member - UX Designer, Visual and UI Designers,  Front-End Developers and Content Authors.   Know who is doing what, when and how. It includes a practical "role-based decision tree" exercise that teams do together for accessibility task planning.</p>
    <p>Your hosts are two co-chairs of the newly-formed W3C Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping (ARRM) Community Group.  Join us!</p>

  <h2 id="Localizing-Digital-Accessibility" class="talk-title">Localizing Digital Accessibility to an Asian Market</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>The majority of the a11y movements are still primarily focused in Europe and North America. However, with the enforcement of EAA, the vendors who won their contracts in East Asia are experiencing a growing pain in the topic. They are asked to ensure their applications to be compliant to EAA when they knew nothing about. The gap for this implies opportunities. However, the opportunities also mean they are starting from almost ground zero. Aside from the language barriers, they also encounter the needs for localizing the concepts to their work.</p>
    <p>This talk focuses on Solomon's experiences in communicating the concepts and the ups and downs when translating the whole initiative to the locals while ensuring nothing is lost in translations.</p>

  <h2 id="Designing-accessible-digital-math" class="talk-title">Designing accessible digital math learning product</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>This presentation focuses on designing inclusive and accessible digital math learning products for K-8 students. We will address the unique cognitive, motor, and sensory needs of younger learners and explore strategies to ensure that math content is accessible, interactive, and engaging. We will also delve into the unique challenges that arise when representing mathematical content in digital formats, particularly for users with low vision and screen readers. </p>

  <h2 id="Creating-Safe-Spaces" class="talk-title">Creating Safe Spaces for Diverse Teams to Thrive</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>We know disability inclusion is good for business and we're starting to see the data that highlights how innovation is inspired when people with disabilities are part of the workforce. For project managers rallying teams to executive and business analysts looking to optimize, disability inclusion can be a game changer, but only if it's accessible for people to contribute in the most meaningful ways. This means challenging current systems and processes and allowing for diverse perspectives to highlight better ways of doing things. We must create the spaces where it's safe to challenge current systems and where we can be open to "different" being "better" than what we currently know. How can we create these spaces?</p>
    <p>Talk Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're going to "get it wrong" - Let's talk about learning and changing to get it right.</li>
      <li>Are you (and your ego) in the way of progress? Change doesn't always mean the way you were doing it was "bad" (How do you know if you've had your favourite meal if you're closed-minded and stuck in your usual dinner rotation?).</li>
      <li>Is the future of workplace health and safety disability inclusion training? I think so! Let's discuss.</li>

<section class="talk">
  <h2 id="Trust-but-Verify" class="talk-title">Trust, but Verify: Navigating Accessibility Claims from Vendors</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>When working with third-party vendors, accessibility professionals are often promised the moon and handed a mirage. From "we meet WCAG 2.0" assurances to glossy VPATs that conveniently skip over known issues, it’s clear that many vendors are either unaware of current standards - or hoping you are. This talk unpacks how to critically assess vendor claims, navigate misleading documentation, and avoid the trap of assuming conformance based on outdated or incomplete information.</p>     <p>We’ll dive into the practicalities of vetting accessibility deliverables, with a focus on understanding what real accessibility looks like versus what’s been checkboxed for compliance. We’ll talk about why WCAG 2.0 is no longer enough, how to spot red flags in demos and audits, and the questions you need to ask before signing on the dotted line. Spoiler: “Is your product accessible?” is not one of them.</p>
    <p>This session is ideal for anyone who’s been burned by a VPAT, found themselves retrofitting a “fully accessible” platform, or is simply tired of the disconnect between vendor promises and user realities. Whether you're in procurement, compliance, design, or just the person who always ends up fixing things - come prepared to leave with a checklist, a clearer strategy, and a few stories that might hit uncomfortably close to home.</p>
