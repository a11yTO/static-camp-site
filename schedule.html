        <p>"Accessibility testing Tools are great, they can become even greater if you can automate your tests. Moreover automatic accessibility tests can be part of your continuous integration pipeline. We will demo some Tools such as pa11y (HTMLCodeSniffer), Axe or Wave with npm (node.js), webpack or puppetter this tools can be used easily by a development team."</p>

        <p>With <a href="https://www.halaanwar.com/iiba-a11y">Hala Anwar</a> at 11:45 in Room 650</p>
        <p>"Business Analysts have traditionally been trained to emphasize Business and Enterprise Change; however, the focus has changed from ‘Deliverables’ to ‘Customer Collaboration and User Experience’ with the introduction of Agile Methodologies. BAs and Product Managers need to be user-centric to build great products, but they often stop short and focus only on generic use cases. This interactive talk will provide examples of how business analysts, and product owners can incorporate inclusive thinking into their existing toolkit (e.g. diverse personas, user stories) and start designing usable experiences that reduce the impact on the development team's velocity."</p>

        <p>With <a href="https://twitter.com/stephen_maguire">Stephen Maguire</a> at 1:45 in Room 650</p>
        <p>Students in the public school system once assessed to have a need for extra support are legally and morally entitled to that support. The reality is that too often the students in question do not receive that direct support. This talk will explore the unfortunate reality of the situation as well as possible ways this aspect of the system could be fixed. At the heart of the issue is a failure to provide the supports needed to increase students access to the education they have a right to.</p>

        <p>Reading on digital platforms is part of our everyday lives, and with the rise of ebooks and audiobooks more and more of our reading happens on devices and the internet. If you have a print disability, this should mean that more and more print content is at your fingertips, and yet this isn't the case. In this talk we'll look at why this is not happening, and what designers, developers, testers, and managers should know about making this possible. </p>

        <p>"At the Canadian Digital Service (CDS), we design for accessibility early and often. This talk will be about a Service Design Barriers Panel that CDS hosted for it's multidisciplinary teams made up for devs, designers, comms, product managers and policy folks. The panel included public servants who have disabilities. We spoke to participants with motor, vision, hearing, neurodiversity and invisible disabilities. I will talk about the methodology, how we led the sessions with people with disabilities, what kind of questions we asked, how the discussions went and what feedback (unexpected) that we got back as well as the key highlights on what we as devs, designers and product managers can do to build more inclusive and accessibility services by engaging and having awareness of the barriers people with disabilities face everyday when using services."</p>
