  <h2 class="talk-name">Fostering inclusion with docs​</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Docs are an essential part of developing and working with technology. Yet good documentation, let alone good accessible documentation, is hard to find. In fact, missing or inaccurate docs are a leading obstacle for developers, impede team productivity, and deter underrepresented groups from contributing to open source projects. And as long as doc work is perceived as low-status, thankless work, this problem is unlikely to change.</p>
    <p>But turning this problem around, we have an opportunity. We can create more diverse and stronger development teams by fostering doc culture and educating authors on the fundamentals of clear writing. Learn about efforts by Google and the wider doc community to build doc culture, improve docs in open source, and help developers to create better documentation.</p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">Skinner boxes and social contracts: the effect of dark patterns on disabled gamers​</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>In the last few years, the game industry has made huge strides in accessibility and making games that are playable by all. The focus, however, has centered only on whether the games CAN be played by a diverse audience, and have largely ignored a murkier side of game design and its effect on disabled gamers. Dark patterns are tools used by designers to intentionally create negative experiences for players without their knowledge. Dark patterns are becoming more prevalent in video games and their effect on disabled gamers can be disastrous. </p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">Designing with Diversity - How Focusing on Accessibility Helped Us Become Better Designers​</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>As members of the TELUS Service Design team, when we were given the opportunity to focus on retail accessibility, we were nervous and excited. The experience of this project was transformative, and pushed us to become better and more inclusive designers. The lessons learned and insights gained from this work have continued to inform our approach to design, and evolved our practice.</p>
    <p>this talk, we will tell the story of what we learned, and how we continue to apply these lessons in order to engage diverse groups in our design process.</p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">Making Sense with AI​</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>We live in a society that uses sound to communicate information by default. This is a huge barrier for people with hearing loss. One incident commonly shared among the d/Deaf & hard of hearing community set Eyra Abraham, founder of Lisnen, on a path to find a solution. This presentation will highlight how Eyra came to discover a solution to the problem by applying artificial intelligence (AI) and explores the impact beyond hearing loss.</p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">​​fAuLT TEXT: The Modern Challenge Of Working With ALT TEXT</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Billions of pictures are uploaded daily to sites and social networks. They are the life and blood of the web, and are the most prevalent resources on a page. However, in a study on accessibility, 70% of sites had missing or inaccurate alternative text. This all too important detail has sadly been left off the required checklist, degrading the user experience for many. In light, solutions around automation of this task have come into play, with much of it revolving around artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision. In fact, browser vendors and social media platforms are beginning to automated image description. However, that has also come with its own challenges.</p>
    <p>fAuLT TEXT: The Modern Challenge Of Working With ALT TEXT is a talk about alternative text, the importance of providing this information, the hurdles that have come in its processing, and though rooted in a good place - how automation isn't a true answer.</p>
